# Just a Random User

[Just a Random User (or JARU)](https://justarandomuser.com/) is a simple and straight-forward random user generator for Designers and Developers. Just click the **Generate User** button or **Spacebar** on your keyboard to generate a random user.

I have plans to keep making this better, especially the images. I'm using the API of [RandomUser.me](https://randomuser.me/) and their image quality isn't the best, I believe the biggest size they have is 128x128, which definitely doesn't come out looking sharp. I plan on using Unsplash's or Pexels's APIs to generate the images sometime in the future.

My goal for building this small tool is to help Designers and Developers quickly find usable user data for their projects instead of using old school lorem ipsum. Being a new Developer, this is my first little participation in giving out to the community.
